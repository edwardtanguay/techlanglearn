## notes

- Angular has life cycle
  - checks every component for changes
- signals
	- since Angular 16
	- methods: signal(), computed(), effect(), mutate()
	- more or less replaces RxJS and is simpler
	- "signal just looks like useState and useEffect in React,with more functionalities like mutable  and compute"
	- "Signals are not just easier to grasp, than RXJS, but they are also closer to what's actually happening under the hood"
	- "the last method is mutate() which I really don't like"
	- effect and signal come from Angular core
	- signals is much easier than RxJS
	- "adding a new layer of functionality (signals) on top of RxJS is questionable"
