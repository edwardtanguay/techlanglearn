## notes

- RxJS vs signals
	- you can't move to signals completely
	- RxJS can be easily mixed with signals
	- you want to use RxJS for more complex situations like implementing debounce
		- use toObservable, toSignal from rxjs-interop
		- so in effect you use signals, but then use RxJS inside them in order to implemment debounce
