## reactivity

- $state() is used inside and outside svelte components
- in Svelte 4 you had to spread values for state arrays
  - no longer the case in Svelte 5
- $inspect(nnn) only works in development
- made store
- in 5, use onclick instead of on:click
- ref works with $effect##thearotoref
- you don't have to input $effect()
- onMount() is replaced with $effect()

## props

- props have simple syntax##propstypeds
- couldn't get children to work instead of slot, although it says slot is deprecated##couldchild
