## first

- snippets instead of components
  - less overhead, don't need to make new file
  - are injected, execute in context
  - keep code flat
  - no additional DOM nodes or lifecycle overhead
- but use components when
  - encapsulating complex UI
  - separate state
  - need to be shared across multiple projects
  - clear separation of concerns
